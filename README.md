# BE:HURD

Hello,

This mini project was part of a take home coding test. The deadline was about a week, so unfortunately, some corners were cut to bring this prototype-mock-up-poc to life.

To run it for yourself, simply:

+ Replace the environment variables in .env  
+ Run `npm install`
+ Run `npm run dev` OR `npm run build` then `npm start`
